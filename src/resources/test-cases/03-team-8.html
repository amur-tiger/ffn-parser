            – I own nothing, mores the pity.</p><P>Team
            8</p><P>Chapter
            One</p><P>It
            had been a long night and Yuuhi Kurenai was exhausted.</p><P>She'd
            gotten an early start that morning, so she could scout out the
            potential new genins at the academy. An unusual number of talented
            students were taking the test this year, probably enough for three
            full teams. That was why the sandaime asked her to take on a genin
            team.</p><P>She'd
            worked independently for almost ten years, ever since that incident.
            She wasn't happy about being forced to work in a team again, but
            when the Hokage asks, he doesn't necessarily have to say please.</p><P>The
            fact that Sarutobi did so made him even harder to refuse.</p><P>The
            old man was actually very considerate of her feelings. He knew that
            this would be opening old wounds, ever since that tragedy…</p><P>She
            ground her teeth to avoid the memory, but only a truly skilled
            shinobi would note any change of expression. Likewise, no one at the
            Academy could have detected her presence as she observed the students
            go through their routines. After the sandaime's 'request', she
            decided to utilize the remaining days to observe the students. This
            was unusual, as most sensei jonins simply waited for the team
            assignments to be made, trusting the academy instructors to construct
            well-balanced teams.</p><P>Kurenai
            was not most jonins.</p><P>Sarutobi
            had asked her to revive an old tactical concept, and lead a team of
            reconnaissance specialists. The last one had come to grief, but she
            didn't think the concept itself was flawed. What happened to
            Nomaru, Mattai, and Kobaru-sensei had been a tragic accident. At
            least that was what she told herself on her good days.</p><P>On
            her bad days, her thoughts were much darker. Sometimes they flirted
            with treason. Of a sort, anyway. If her suspicions were correct, she
            wasn't alone in such thoughts, just in failing to act on them.</p><P>However,
            she'd been having good days recently, so she occupied herself by
            watching the potential genins, unheard and unseen. The Inuzuka kid
            almost sensed her presence during recess when the wind unexpectedly
            shifted, but she'd been able to move before he could smell her.</p><P>Mostly
            she watched them talk and play. She noticed an unusual number of
            children from prominent shinobi families. Just like their parents, a
            Nara, a Yamanaka, and an Akimichi were all set to graduate together.
            If they all passed, there was little doubt they'd be placed on a
            team together. People liked to stick with what worked. It was just
            too bad for the boys that the Yamanaka girl looked to be an
            incredible shrew.</p><P>She
            saw a few prospects for a recon team. There was an Aburame kid who
            was so quiet the instructors tended to lose track of him. If he was
            any good with his bugs he'd be a resource for any team. She'd
            worked on occasion with a man who was probably this Shino boy's
            father. His 'little friends' always warned them of approaching
            enemies, giving them plenty of time to change position. The Inuzuka
            boy undoubtedly had a good nose like most of his family, as would his
            dog. He was a little loud, and a bit of a braggart though.</p><P>There
            was also a Hyuuga there, and Kurenai recognized the girl, Hinata,
            that she'd escorted to the academy years ago. She'd done a tour
            at the Academy while recovering from her wounds and preparing for the
            jonin exam.</p><P>She'd
            been dispatched to the Hyuuga compound in response to a request from
            the clan head, Hyuuga Hiashi. The man coldly informed her that his
            daughter was hopelessly weak and unable to master more than the
            basics of the Hyuuga gentle fist taijitsu style. It was hoped that
            she'd be of some use to the village as a shinobi if she was too
            weak to serve the family directly. The fact that he told her this in
            front of the silent girl sorely tested Kurenai's patience.</p><P>Of
            course, she expected no less from the leader of the white-eyed
            bastards. Aside from that silent girl, she'd never seen a member of
            that prestigious family that wasn't stuck up and arrogant. Well,
            Mattai wasn't like that, but it wasn't really the same.
            Remembering her old comrade always brought a pang, and she needed her
            concentration to focus on the quiet girl.</p><P>As
            if in reaction against the rest of her family's arrogance, the
            Hyuuga girl was still painfully shy and timid. She sat by herself and
            kept her head down so much it took Kurenai a while to confirm she
            actually had the Byakugan eyes her family was famed for. The only
            time the girl seemed to perk up at all was when the class
            troublemaker came tearing past, being chased by the Yamanaka girl and
            some pink-haired kunoichi-in-training that had to be a Haruno.</p><P>Kurenai
            was a genin fresh out of the academy when the Kyuubi attacked Konoha.
            She and most of her friends were assigned to areas of the battlefield
            far from the worst of the fighting, which was probably the only
            reason any of them had survived that night. She didn't have any
            personal animosity against the child the fourth had sealed the demon
            fox into. It wasn't like the little gaki had asked for it.</p><P>Still,
            this Uzumaki Naruto seemed to be quite a handful. He was always
            pulling pranks, though never anything really mean or hurtful. Mostly
            he just seemed a little starved for attention. Unfortunately, that
            was something most of the academy instructors seemed unwilling to
            give him. To his credit, Umino Iruka seemed to be the least
            prejudiced of the lot: his irritation seemed to be focused more on
            the boy's poor study habits and hell-raising.</p><P>At
            least his antics were occasionally entertaining. He did show a lot of
            creativity in his mischief, and the reactions of those around him
            also gave Kurenai some insight into their personalities.</p><P>Unfortunately,
            it looked like his lack of focus had caught up with him that
            afternoon, during the genin exam. A fair number of his classmates ran
            out of the building afterward, proudly displaying their new
            Hitai-ite, but the blond haired boy just trudged over to the swings
            and sat there, the picture of dejection.</p><P>Kurenai
            was surprised to note that someone else was watching the boy as well.
            The Hyuuga girl stared at him from behind a post. She was obviously
            distraught - blushing and pushing her forefingers together in a
            nervous gesture. At the same time, the girl stood up straighter than
            Kurenai had ever seen her. She fidgeted behind the post, stepping out
            from behind it only to step back again without doing anything. From
            what Kurenai could see, the girl's cheeks were bright red.</p><P>The
            jonin smiled to herself as she slipped away. With no curse seal, the
            girl was obviously of the Hyuuga main family. For such a one to be
            attracted to a ruffian like the one who bore the kyuubi was an
            ineradicable smear on her family's honor.</p><P>Good
            for her.</p><P>The
            thought cheered Kurenai as she made her way to the Hokage's tower.
            The Sandaime and the new jonin sensei would be meeting with the
            academy instructors to go over the test results and decide how to
            split the new genins into effective teams.</p><P>It
            was nearly nightfall by the time all the jonins arrived, mostly due
            to Hatake Kakashi's chronic tardiness. She understood the reasons
            for his frequent diversions all too well, but that was not a good
            reason to make everyone wait for over an hour. Although she supposed
            the same could be said of her violent dislike of the Hyuuga clan.</p><P>The
            first bit of bad news was that only eight students had passed the
            genin test. That meant one team would be short a student, or they
            would be forming two four person teams. Kurenai wondered if she'd
            be let off the hook, but Sarutobi soon scuttled that hope. He said he
            didn't think the best of jonins could give four students sufficient
            attention for their development. The jonins sometimes whispered on
            drinking nights that the old man still blamed himself for
            Orochimaru's betrayal of Konoha. No sane person blamed the old man
            for his grown student's actions, but Kurenai knew quite well that
            guilt follows no logic but it's own.</p><P>No
            sooner had they settled that question and began wrangling over who
            would only have two genins than a messenger arrived. It seemed that
            someone had broken into the Sandaime's quarters and made off with a
            scroll of forbidden jutsus. No one was sure who had done it, but
            Uzumaki Naruto had been seen in the vicinity just before the break-in
            was noticed.</p><P>Umino
            Iruka went pale as a ghost when he heard this news, confirming to
            Kurenai's eye that the man did care something about the unwanted
            child. He immediately rushed out to join the search for the boy.</p><P>"How
            did Naruto do in the examination?" the Sandaime asked one of the
            academy record-keepers.</p><P>"He
            did not pass, Hokage-sama," the man asked without even checking his
            scroll.</p><P>"If
            he was able to break into the Hokage's office and make off with a
            heavily guarded scroll… it makes me wonder how hard that test is,"
            Asuma grumbled sourly. He'd been forbidden to smoke inside and
            Kurenai was sure he was suffering from lack of nicotine.</p><P>Sarutobi
            seemed unusually unconcerned about the missing scroll, so after he
            went up to his office they instead sat around discussing the
            strengths and weaknesses of the genins as they looked through the
            reports. It seemed a little odd to do this when neither of the senior
            instructors were present.</p><P>Kakashi
            volunteered to oversee the training of the Uchiha survivor, which
            made sense given his use of a sharingan eye. He also was willing to
            only have two students. This was presumably so he could devote more
            time to Uchiha Sasuke, but Kurenai wondered how much of that was just
            laziness. It seemed to her that the more skilled the ninja, the more
            eccentric their personal habits became. It also made her wonder if
            her own ambitions to improve her skills would become ultimately
            self-destructive. The copy-cat ninja was feared throughout the ninja
            world, but he was also squirrelly as hell with his chronic tardiness
            and perverted reading material.</p><P>In
            fact his fingers were reaching for the corner of a brightly colored
            book protruding from his flak vest when Sarutobi led Iruka back into
            the room, the latter missing his hitai-ite.</p><P>"It
            looks like we have a ninth graduate," the chuunin gasped after
            sitting down. He looked like he'd been in a nasty brawl – he was
            covered with cuts and scrapes, including a really large gouge in the
            middle of his back.</p><P>"What
            happened, Iruka?" Maybe it was Kurenai's imagination, but the
            slight smile the Hokage wore indicated he knew more than he let on.</p><P>"It
            was Mizuki that betrayed us, Hokage-sama. When Naruto couldn't
            produce a good bunshin, he failed the jutsu portion of the exam.
            Mizuki told him that stealing the scroll and bringing it to him would
            count as extra credit and allow him to still pass the exam."</p><P>"He
            fell for that?" Kakashi asked in surprise. "And we're
            considering making him a ninja why?</p><P>"If
            students cannot trust their sensei, who can they trust?" Iruka
            asked stiffly. "We cannot punish him for listening to a teacher,
            can we?" He turned toward the Hokage with the last question.</p><P>The
            Sandaime nodded gravely. "I agree. If we cannot guarantee the
            loyalty of the people who teach our children, we cannot blame them
            for doing no better than we." He looked at Iruka for a second.
            "What happened to your forehead protector?"</p><P>Umino
            Iruka smiled proudly. "I gave it to Naruto for passing the exam.
            He'd failed to produce a simple bunshin, but when he was defending
            me from Mizuki's attacks he revealed that he'd learned Kage
            Bunshin no Jutsu and filled that whole section of the forest with
            clones. I literally lost count."</p><P>"But
            Kage Bunshin is much harder to perform!" Asuma protested.</p><P>Iruka
            shrugged happily. "That's why I passed him. He's quite
            surprising."</p><P>"Well
            then, it looks like we have three full size teams now," Sarutobi
            said with a faint smile. Most of the jonins knew he sympathized with
            the boy's lack of family. "Kakashi, if you will take Naruto, that
            will-"</p><P>"Your
            pardon, Hokage-sama," Kurenai broke in. She'd been thinking about
            the Hyuuga girl. With her bloodline, she had tremendous potential,
            but her confidence issues were worrisome. Now she saw a possible way
            around them. "I wouldn't mind having Naruto on my team."</p><P>"Are
            you sure of that?" Sarutobi asked. She also saw Asuma and some of
            the academy workers quietly shaking their heads. "I understand your
            team is to specialize in reconnaissance missions, and Naruto doesn't
            show a lot of potential in that area."</p><P>"Or
            any other," she thought she saw one of the record keepers mouth to
            his co-worker. Iruka shifted painfully in his seat to glare at them.</p><P>"After
            what happened to my genin team," she said coolly, "I'd prefer
            that my new team not be overly specialized. If they fall into a
            trap," she continued, giving the last word a slightly sarcastic
            emphasis that made the Sandaime wince, "it would do well to have
            someone with the ability to get us out of a perilous situation. A
            genin capable of filling the woods with kage bunshin would be able to
            provide quite a distraction, wouldn't he? Besides, I also seem to
            remember a large number of chuunins, jonins, and ANBU pursuing that
            boy after he decorated the Hokage monument. He led you on quite a
            chase, didn't he?"</p><P>Several
            faces in the room looked a bit sheepish after that. Iruka, on the
            other hand, appeared happy that someone was recognizing his pupil's
            abilities. Of course, he was also the one who eventually caught the
            boy.</p><P>She
            turned toward Kakashi. "Kiba is passable with his taijitsu, but he
            also spends a lot of time working with Akamaru. They work well
            together and might give your students an example of the teamwork you
            seem to prize. Psychologically, the Inuzuka boy is like most of his
            family and very pack, er, group-oriented. He's a little boisterous,
            but friendly enough he might be able to thaw out that Uchiha
            headcase."</p><P>Kurenai
            noticed that everyone in the room was staring at her. She sighed.
            "When I was selected to mentor a genin team, I decided to spend a
            few days observing them interact and getting a handle on their
            personalities. Am I the only jonin in this room that bothers to think
            ahead?"</p><P>Kakashi
            was reading his book and Asuma was fiddling with his cigarette.
            Evidently, she was.</p><P>She
            sighed and laid her face in her hands. "Fine, then. Just take my
            word for it. The Uchiha kid is a self-centered brat and you're
            going to have your work cut out for you."</p><P>"Hmmm…"
            Sarutobi grunted. "I would think Naruto would be able to warm him
            up a bit better. And it is traditional that the highest and
            lowest-ranked genins be placed on the same team to balance it out."</p><P>"Perhaps,"
            Kurenai agreed. "But I think that kid's been through enough
            without sticking him on a team with two people who won't appreciate
            him, and neither Haruno nor Uchiha respect him at all… Besides,
            given what he did tonight, I'm not sure I agree with his assessment
            results."</p><P>The
            third Hokage nodded thoughtfully. "You think he will do better on
            your team?"</p><P>"Aburame
            Shino seems neutral toward the boy, which is better than the outright
            disparagement he receives from other students. Hyuuga Hinata would be
            his friend if she were not so shy." Kurenai paused for a moment
            before continuing. "I believe that if your law mandating secrecy
            regarding the jinchuuriki were to be strictly enforced, all of the
            academy students would be made orphans."</p><P>Yuuhi
            Kurenai was quite sure that, were she to drop a senbon, the clatter
            when it struck the floor would have been deafening in that silence.</p><P>"That
            is ridiculous!" One of the academy workers snapped. "I have never
            heard one whisper of the Kyuubi in all the time I have worked here.
            No parent has told their child of it!"</p><P>"No,"
            Kurenai drawled, "they instead tell their children to hate Uzumaki
            Naruto and shun him for no reason they will admit. You don't hide a
            secret by drawing attention to it with bright lights and dancing
            around it doing everything you can get away with that doesn't
            involve saying the forbidden words."</p><P>Sarutobi
            sighed and sagged in his chair for a moment. Kurenai was reminded how
            old he actually was, and how he'd been enjoying his retirement up
            until his successor was forced to sacrifice his life to seal the
            Kyuubi. She felt a stab of shame that she'd reminded him of how
            little some of the villagers deserved his protection.</p><P>"Anyway,"
            she continued in a kinder voice, "I think the gaki has a lot of
            potential. If I can bring it out, he may one day become a formidable
            shinobi."</p><P>"That
            may be a lot of work," Iruka said in a cautious voice. Kurenai's
            eye caught him wincing a little, obviously torn by his loyalty to the
            boy. She considered that a point in his favor.</p><P>"It
            will be worth it to prevent any more… accidents," she said in
            little more than a whisper. Even Kakashi managed to look
            uncomfortable, for all that his mask hid.</p><P>"Very
            well," the Hokage said in a quiet voice. "I will want weekly
            reports on the boy's progress and his physical and mental state."</p><P>Kurenai
            nodded. She expected as much.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Hyuuga
            Hinata had not slept well that night. Yesterday had been the last day
            she'd likely see Naruto in a long time. She passed her Genin Exam,
            but he would be staying at the academy for remedial classes until he
            could pass. He tried so hard that it broke her heart to see him fail.
            For once, his smiling mask had slipped and he'd walked outside like
            a broken down old man.</p><P>And
            still she failed to say anything to the boy who inspired her so much
            with his attitude and ever-present smile. Her father was right –
            she was a useless coward. Not brave enough to do more than hide and
            watch him like some pathetic stalker.</p><P>She'd
            always been a little embarrassed for the sillier kunoichis who chased
            Uchiha Sasuke around like a miniature fan club. But in the end, was
            she any better? She was just as hare-brained and silly, and even more
            cowardly. Those girls at least had the courage to let Sasuke know
            that they liked him. Not even the prospect of not seeing Naruto
            anymore could make her act, and she despised herself for it.</p><P>She'd
            been too upset at herself to even think of eating breakfast, and her
            steps faltered as she slowly walked to the Konoha Ninja Academy for
            the last time. Her only consolation was the possibility that she
            might see Naruto there again today. It was fairly common for students
            who failed the Genin Exam to stay home the following day – it was
            painful and embarrassing to see your classmates who were leaving to
            become full-fledged shinobi, even if they were only reporting to a
            different room for team assignments. But then again, Naruto seldom
            did the usual thing. The prospect of seeing him again, even if it
            would be the last time in a long while, buoyed her spirit. Maybe
            today she would find the courage to actually speak to him.</p><P>Her
            steps quickened as hope slowly leaked into her heart. She soon made
            her way into the academy building and found the classroom where the
            new genins were assembled.</p><P>Her
            classmates were spread out in their usual disarray, but Naruto was
            there as well, with his head down on a desk. She froze in shock as
            she walked in the door, but then her feet automatically led her to
            one of her usual seats; high up and near the door in the back –
            everyone ahead of her and no one behind. She stared at the boy,
            wondering if someone would come in and tell him to leave. Finally,
            Nara Shikamaru ambled into the room and stopped by Naruto's table.
            When he asked Naruto why he was there, the blond boy sat up and said
            he'd passed, showing off his new hitai-ite. "Naruto-kun graduated
            too," she whispered to herself.</p><P>Then
            Ino and Sakura burst into the room, arguing about who arrived first.
            Naruto stared in her direction, his face lighting up, and Hinata felt
            her heart skip a beat. But then the pink-haired kunoichi walked by
            her and she realized Naruto was looking at her instead.</p><P>"Ohayo,
            Sakura-chan!" Naruto greeted her with a smile as she approached.</p><P>"Out
            of my way!" Sakura snarled as she elbowed him to the floor so she
            could sit next to Uchiha Sasuke.</p><P>An
            unpleasant voice in Hinata's head said it was glad that the girl
            Naruto seemed to like did not return his affections. But for the most
            part, she was dismayed to see him treated so cavalierly. Then Ino
            contested Sakura's right to sit in the chair she'd just thrown
            poor Naruto out of. In moments, most of the girls in the room were
            arguing over the evicted seat while Naruto was still sprawled at
            their feet.</p><P>Naruto
            climbed up on the desk and glared at Sasuke, again attracting the ire
            of Sasuke's fan club. Even worse, an inattentive boy at the table
            in front of them bumped into Naruto, making his and Sasuke's faces
            meet. It was hard to tell from where she sat, but from the screams of
            outrage that followed immediately afterward, it seems the two boys
            had inadvertently kissed. Hinata thought it was somewhat funny,
            especially the way the two boys carried on afterwards, spitting and
            gagging like they'd been poisoned.</p><P>The
            Sasuke Fan Club ™ on the other hand, was incensed at Naruto's
            forward behavior – not to mention quite jealous. The beating they
            gave Naruto was well out of proportion to his actual offense. Hinata
            grew worried as they showed no signs of stopping. She pushed back her
            chair and was about to intervene when Iruka-sensei entered the room
            and broke it up. Poor Naruto looked like he'd been run over by a
            farmer's wagon.</p><P>When
            Iruka-sensei announced that the teams had been chosen, Hinata began
            pressing her index fingers together as her thoughts raced. <em>I might
                be on a team with Naruto-kun. I might not be on a team with
                Naruto-kun. </em>Those two thoughts kept repeating as the instructor
            worked his way down the list.</p><P>"Team
            Seven: Inuzuka Kiba, Haruno Sakura, and Uchiha Sasuke."</p><P>Sakura
            looked ecstatic as Ino's face fell. Naruto also seemed horribly
            disappointed, and Hinata couldn't help but feel sorry for him, even
            though her own hopes were rising.</p><P>"Team
            Eight: Hyuuga Hinata, Uzumaki Naruto, and Aburame Shino."</p><P>Naruto's
            expression didn't change, but Hinata thought her heart would
            explode out of her chest. She knew her racing pulse was making her
            cheeks flush, but she couldn't help it. Not only had Naruto passed,
            but they would be together on the same team. This was rapidly
            becoming one of the happiest days of her life, definitely the
            happiest since her mother died.</p><P>When
            the team assignments were completed, they were given a long lunch
            break, as their jonin instructors would be meeting with them that
            afternoon. Sasuke immediately got up and stalked out of the room,
            Sakura trailing behind him. Kiba grunted as he stood up, frowning at
            already being left behind by his team.</p><P>Naruto
            stared after Sakura, and sat in silence after she left. Hinata felt
            ashamed that she'd been happy he was on her team instead of
            Sakura's. She was an awful person if she took joy from the sadness
            of someone she admired. She looked down at her hands and began
            pressing her fingers again. She was too ashamed to look up as Naruto
            left the room.</p><P>After
            a while she got up and went outside. She saw Aburame Shino sitting on
            a bench near the playground. Determined to get to know her other
            teammate, Hinata sat down on the other end of the bench from the
            silent boy.</p><P>"Ano…
            I understand we are to be teammates," she said in a quiet voice.</p><P>The
            Aburame genius turned toward her, his face expressionless – what
            little of it she could see behind the high collar and the dark
            glasses he wore. "Hai," he said in little more than a whisper. He
            then turned back and Hinata realized he was studying an ant hill that
            had been constructed in front of the bench.</p><P>Hinata
            blinked and began unpacking her lunch. She thought of offering some
            to her teammate. She tended to bring more than she needed, on the off
            chance that one day Naruto would forget to bring his usual cup ramen.
            Alas, she never had the chance to share her food with him… not that
            she would've had the courage to approach him, she reproached
            herself bitterly.</p><P>Shino,
            however, had also brought food. It was a little disconcerting to see
            his kikai bugs swarming onto the dish as they consumed a portion of
            his rice and fish. They confined themselves to one corner of the
            square container as Shino's chopsticks fed their host.</p><P>Hinata
            bit into a rice ball and wondered what she could do. She'd never
            been in this position before, trying to converse with someone who was
            even quieter than she was. "Ano… which jonin do you think we will
            be assigned to?"</p><P>Shino
            turned toward her again. He seemed to stare at her for a long moment,
            making her fingers fidget even faster. "Given our abilities, I
            would think one of the scouting specialists. Uzumaki's presence is
            troubling though."</p><P>Hinata
            took a deep breath. "I'm sure he will work very hard to make us
            successful," she said in as firm a voice as she could muster.</p><P>Shino
            simply regarded her for several heartbeats before answering.
            "Perhaps. But he doesn't possess a bloodline or sensory
            abilities. I question what role he could perform, or if he was simply
            placed here to keep him out of the way."</p><P>Hinata
            felt her stomach contract into a small, hard ball. She always
            questioned whether she would actually be useful as a ninja or not.
            Was Team 8 just a place for throwaway ninjas? Had she and Naruto been
            placed here to keep them out of the way? But what about Shino? He was
            supposed to be the pride of the Aburame clan, the best bug user
            they'd produced in over a generation. "Ano… I don't think
            we're a team for shinobi that no one wants. Naruto works very hard
            when he trains by himself, and he still received a hitai-ite. "</p><P>Shino
            turned back toward his lunch. "That may have been done to remove
            him from the academy. There is something about him that the adults do
            not like. My clan will not speak of it, but they do not hold him in
            high regard."</p><P>While
            Hinata was glad that Shino was speaking more, his words disturbed
            her. She remembered the way her father's face twisted when one of
            Naruto's pranks was mentioned at dinner. The branch family retainer
            blanched under Otousan's furious glare, and for an instant Hinata
            thought his cursed seal had been activated. Hinata may not have been
            the ideal Hyuuga warrior, but even without her Byakugan active, she
            was still intelligent and above all, observant. As such, the looks
            some of the adults gave the object of her affections did not escape
            her notice. "Surely they don't hate him for pulling a few pranks?
            Naruto-kun never hurt anyone, not even by accident."</p><P>"I
            believe it's something deeper than that. I've heard his name
            mentioned in passing even before the first time he defaced the Hokage
            Monument," Shino replied.</p><P>Hinata
            was too involved in their conversation to wonder at how her teammate
            seemed to have finally discovered that he had a voice. Later, she
            would wonder if it was the teasing apart of a mystery that finally
            engaged him, or if it was simply the fact that someone was actively
            seeking to speak with him. Hinata wasn't especially fond of
            insects, but they didn't creep her out like they did some girls.
            "What else could he have done to become so unpopular?" she asked,
            frowning.</p><P>"It
            may not be anything he did," Shino replied. "I don't know of
            another Uzumaki in the village, so he may have come from a family
            that disgraced themselves in some fashion. Hokage-sama wouldn't
            execute a child for the crimes of the parents, no matter how heinous.
            The villagers may not be so forgiving."</p><P>Hinata
            sat there, her mind racing as a half-eaten rice ball fell back into
            her bentou. As far as she knew, Naruto-kun had no parents, and was
            forced to live alone as there was no one who would take him in. To
            think that he would still be blamed for the actions of people he'd
            never met made her feel very strangely. It was similar to the tight
            feeling she got when Otousan told her Hanabi would make a better heir
            and how she at least could make him proud… but the emotion gripping
            her right now was much stronger.</p><P>Hyuuga
            Hinata was angry. These people deliberately hurt her Naruto-kun with
            their cold eyes. The boy with the big dreams who always smiled and
            tried again no matter what – he deserved better than that. She'd
            seen his smile slip a few times, the most recently after the Genin
            Exam, and even if she was too cowardly to say anything to him, his
            sorrow still stabbed her heart like a kunai. After a moment she was
            able to master her new emotions and don the sterile mask she was
            taught a Hyuuga must always present to others. "That is very
            foolish of them," she said coldly, "since he is going to be
            Hokage some day."</p><P>Shino
            didn't say anything, but turned back to his lunch. While he didn't
            necessarily sound like he agreed with her, Hinata would settle for a
            lack of overt disagreement. They finished their meal in silence and
            returned to the academy to await their sensei.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Naruto
            sat at his desk with his head in his hands. The ache in his stomach
            was finally subsiding, but the pain in his heart was worse. It wasn't
            fair that Sakura was assigned to a different team, and even worse
            that she was partnered up with that Uchiha-teme.</p><P>When
            he saw Sasuke eating his lunch, Naruto was struck by inspiration.
            This might be his last chance to find out what Sakura really thought
            of him. Fortunately, the overconfident jerk was surprisingly easy to
            subdue. So much for genius. The look on his face when the kawarimi
            log appeared in a cloud of smoke and half a dozen clones descended on
            him like the wrath of Kami was the high point of Naruto's day.
            After that it was simply a matter of tying the fool up and using
            Henge no Jutsu to copy his appearance.</p><P>He
            found Sakura where he'd left her – scorning his presence and
            mooning after Sasuke-teme. He didn't think she could really be that
            cruel – not when she was so beautiful and smiled so sweetly. The
            way her face lit up as he approached made the breath catch in his
            throat, and for a moment he almost forgot that she was reacting to
            Sasuke's appearance, not his own.</p><P>After
            a moment, he remembered his plan and sat down on the stone bench next
            to her. He tried to copy Sasuke's patented slouch and glower, and
            it seemed to work. Sakura smiled shyly and blushed.</p><P>"So,"
            Naruto said, trying to sound disinterested. "What's the deal with
            that Naruto boy who seems to like you? He's always greets you
            warmly every morning and you usually bash him on the head."</p><P>Sakura
            looked confused for a moment before giggling. "That Naruto, he's
            always such a pain. He doesn't really understand me, and he's
            always interfering with my plans." She sighed. "At least he's
            not on a team with us, and after today I won't ever have to look at
            him again. Aren't you relieved as well, Sasuke-kun?"</p><P>Naruto
            didn't trust his voice at that moment as he felt his heart shrivel
            up and blow away. He just grunted and stood up again. He slouched
            away as Sakura called after him. He refused to acknowledge her
            confused cries. Maybe she might come to know how it feels. Not that
            she cared. He was halfway to the academy building when his stomach
            began cramping violently.</p><P>Naruto
            did raise his head when he felt a presence full of killing intent
            enter the classroom. Sasuke didn't look at him directly as he
            stalked over to an empty seat, but Naruto could feel the anger
            radiating from the boy. Naruto also knew the stuck up Uchiha wouldn't
            say a word about what happened – he'd sooner die than admit that
            the 'dead last' had beaten him down in a fight. While he had been
            taken by surprise, it was no excuse for someone that was trained in
            the ninja arts… let alone the almighty Uchiha genius.</p><P>Naruto
            didn't even look directly at the boy, who also ignored Sakura's
            confused expression. "Those two deserve each other," he thought
            bitterly. "She just seems to irritate him, and now she'll get a
            chance to see how it's like to be ignored and despised."</p><P>His
            mind was so wrapped up in his misery that he almost missed Iruka
            calling out for Team 8. He stood up and sullenly shuffled over to the
            teacher's desk. Iruka frowned at him as he joined Hinata and Shino.
            Iruka-sensei introduced a tall woman with shoulder-length black hair
            and red eyes. "This is Yuuhi Kurenai. She will be your jonin
            instructor. Good luck to all of you." Iruka smiled when Naruto
            nodded and straightened the hitai-ite that Iruka had given him.</p><P>Kurenai
            smiled faintly, but her eyes were watchful as she led them outside.
            Hinata smiled at him, a little hesitantly. Naruto actually respected
            her for being one of the few girls in their class that didn't spend
            all their time fawning over Uchicha-teme. Shino was a little odd. He
            didn't talk much, just the opposite of Naruto, but the other kids
            avoided him because of the bugs, which was something they had in
            common. Naruto didn't mind bugs, as long as they didn't try to
            get into his food. His live-and-let-live attitude ended where his
            ramen began.</p><P>As
            he walked out the door, Naruto found himself looking back at Kiba,
            Sasuke, and Sakura, who were still waiting for their jonin instructor
            to show up. He took a deep breath and turned his back on them,
            leaving with his new team.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Kurenai
            didn't miss the blond boy's backward glance as she led them out
            of the classroom. "He must be disappointed he wasn't teamed with
            that Haruno girl," she concluded to herself, "not that she ever
            gave him the time of day. Was I ever that young and stupid? Surely
            not."</p><P>She
            spoke aloud after leading them out to the playground. "Now, I'd
            like to get to know each of you, so please tell me a little about
            yourselves." It was better to handle introductions in a familiar
            place, to put them all at ease. "I'll begin. I am Yuuhi Kurenai,
            and I became a jonin after the last exam. I'm a specialist with
            various types of genjutsu. I like to study human psychology, sing
            karaoke, and work in my garden. I dislike loud drunks and people who
            think I can't be an effective ninja because I'm a woman. My
            ambition is to prove that a reconnaissance specialized team can be
            successful and to see all three of you become jonins."</p><P>Naruto
            looked at each of his less-than-talkative teammates and then cleared
            his throat. "I'm Uzumaki Naruto. I like ramen. I hate how long it
            takes to make instant ramen and stuck up bastards like Sasuke-teme.
            My ambition is to one day become Hokage."</p><P>When
            neither Shino or Hinata showed signs of speaking up, Naruto nudged
            the Aburame boy. Shino's head snapped around at Naruto so quickly
            the blond flinched back. Kurenai wondered if the bug-user was used to
            any sort of human contact. "I am Aburame Shino. I like to study
            insects and find new varieties that haven't been catalogued by my
            family yet. I dislike people who kill insects for no reason. My
            ambition is to learn all of the Aburame bloodline jutsus and then
            develop my own techniques using my allies."</p><P>Once
            the taller boy finished, everyone looked toward Hinata, who appeared
            to be ready to sink into the ground without the benefit of a Doton
            jutsu. "A-ano… I am Hyuuga Hinata. I like cheerful people… who
            are kind. I dislike… people who hurt others… for no reason. My
            ambition is to become stronger so I will be acknowledged by my
            father… and someone else."</p><P>Kurenai
            nodded thoughtfully. Shino was just as focused, or obsessed, as she
            thought. Hinata's home life was probably just as bad as she'd
            imagined from watching her. Naruto's focus was scattered all over
            the place, which was also about what she expected. He was going to
            need a lot of work, and the sooner she started the better. "Very
            good. Now, are you all familiar with training ground number
            nineteen?" she asked, specifying a variable-terrain space set aside
            along the southern border of the village. When all three of them
            nodded she continued. "Good. We're going to do a short skill
            assessment. Meet me there as quickly as you can." With that, her
            hands blurred into a seal and she disappeared in a sudden swirl of
            wind-blown leaves.</p><P>As
            soon as the substitution technique was finished, Kurenai took off for
            the designated training area at her best speed, leaping from roof to
            roof and tree to tree. With her advanced chakra control, she could
            feed a trickle of energy into her legs, allowing her to reach
            incredible speeds as she traveled overhead.</p><P>Surprisingly,
            she barely beat Naruto there. All that being chased after pranking
            had to pay off somehow. The boy had incredible stamina, just as she
            suspected. He was blowing hard and sweating when he arrived, but his
            color and respiration normalized in less than three minutes. It's
            not like he could ever use stealth to escape from pursuers, not with
            that bright orange jumpsuit.</p><P>Shino
            arrived a few minutes later, followed shortly by a badly-winded
            Hinata.</p><P>"I
            can see we're going to need to work on speed and endurance both,"
            Kurenai said, frowning.</p><P>"Is
            that because we're going to be a reconnaissance team?" Shino
            asked.</p><P>"Yes
            and no," Kurenai answered. "Moving quickly is especially
            important for successfully completing a scouting mission. However,
            endurance training will also help increase your chakra reserves,
            which will in turn improve your taijutsu and make your ninjutsus
            easier to use."</p><P>Shino
            and Hinata nodded at this. Naruto just looked confused. "What do
            you all mean by a reconnaissance team?" he finally asked.</p><P>Kurenai
            nodded to acknowledge his question. If the boy had as hard a time in
            the academy as she thought, she didn't want him to be reluctant to
            ask her for information. "That's a very good question, Naruto.
            When genins are selected for teams, it's common practice to put
            members together who have powers that compliment each other. For
            example, Team 10 has a Nara, a Yamanaka, and an Akimichi. Their
            fathers all worked together as well. The Nara and Yamanaka bloodlines
            are especially useful for capturing or immobilizing people, and
            Akimichis excel at grappling techniques. Furthermore, the Akimichis
            have some special attacks that are truly devastating, but somewhat
            easy to avoid."</p><P>Naruto
            frowned for a moment. "So Ino and Shikamaru hold them while Chouji
            pounds them?"</p><P>Kurenai
            nodded. "That's one way their abilities compliment each other.
            Now a reconnaissance team has members whose abilities make them
            especially well suited for finding the enemy or discovering their
            secrets. Sometimes that information is more valuable than gold –
            being able to adequately prepare for the enemy has decided more wars
            than any fighting technique or jutsu."</p><P>"Ano,
            K-kurenai-sensei," Hinata spoke up, "how do my, I mean our
            abilities make us suited for such a role?"</p><P>"That's
            also a very good question, Hinata. Your Byakugan eyes are an obvious
            asset. You can see for very long distances and through light cover
            when you activate them. With proper positioning, you can see into a
            commander's tent and read his battle plans with no one being the
            wiser. Shino's bugs can also be invaluable when seeking out the
            enemy. I've worked with members of his clan before, and the kikai
            bugs have an excellent sense of smell. They also make good sentries.
            When deployed around the team, they can alert us if an enemy patrol
            is approaching. One of the greatest hazards of getting close to the
            enemy is the chance that they will stumble over you and attack."</p><P>Kurenai
            paused, thinking about how to phrase what she wanted to say next.
            Naruto, however, noticed the incompleteness of her response.</p><P>"Sensei,
            what role do I play?" he asked, his eyebrows drawn down in a frown.</p><P>Kurenai
            sighed. "I won't lie to you. The scouting missions our team will
            likely be assigned will be dangerous. That is why I don't want this
            team to be over specialized in that role. Naruto, if the worst
            happens and we are discovered deep in enemy territory, your job will
            be to buy us time to escape. Your… unexpected… skill with Kage
            Bunshin makes you well suited toward distracting pursuers so we can
            successfully disengage."</p><P>"So
            it's all about running away?" Naruto asked, sticking out his
            lower lip.</p><P>"Yes,
            it is," Kurenai answered sharply. "Because completing your
            mission is what shinobi do. Proving who's tougher is a schoolyard
            game. Staying to fight when the Hokage needs our information isn't
            just stupid, it's treasonous. Ninjas who don't learn that lesson
            usually die as fools. Their names won't even be carved onto the
            memorial stone because they threw their lives away, rather than
            sacrificing them for something meaningful."</p><P>Everyone
            grew quiet after that. Kurenai gave them a moment to digest that,
            then set them to work on basic taijutsu drills. Hinata proved to be
            the best of the bunch. Her form was almost perfect, and her movements
            were swift and precise. While she may lack somewhat in power and
            speed, that would come as she got older. Shino's taijutsu was
            workmanlike, not particularly inspired, but she was sure he practiced
            it more for the chakra enhancement than anything else. More chakra
            meant more energy for his bugs. Naruto's stances were awful and his
            form was unbelievably sloppy. At the same time, he was blindingly
            fast and seemed to pull off the wall moves out of thin air. When he
            sparred with Shino, he proved unusually adept at using the terrain to
            his advantage, ricocheting off an overhanging branch to land a kick
            on the taller boy's head.</p><P>Kurenai
            scowled as she realized why his hand to hand skills were so
            undisciplined. With no friends and no parents, he could only practice
            outside of school by himself. He was probably going to one of the
            training grounds and trying to teach himself the more advanced
            taijutsu moves, possibly after watching older ninjas train. It was a
            wonder he wasn't worse. She considered her possibilities as she
            watched Shino knock the smaller boy down for the fifth time in a row.</p><P>"Yamete!
            That's enough." The boys separated and she noticed that after two
            deep breaths Naruto didn't even appear to have been exercising at
            all. Taijutsu wasn't one of her strengths, but she did know someone
            who was quite good… and Gai had been asking her for tips on
            teaching his genins how to recognize advanced genjutsus.</p><P>She
            then had them demonstrate some of their preferred ninjutsus. Shino
            used his kikai bugs to turn a log into a pile of sawdust in less than
            a minute. Hinata did a henge of Kurenai that was picture perfect –
            until the shy and hesitant body language immediately revealed the
            imposter. Naruto leapt to his feet when it was his turn and called
            out "Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!" in an enthusiastic voice.</p><P>There
            was a loud pop and two more Narutos appeared on either side of him.
            Both looked rather pale and sickly. One immediately ran behind some
            bushes and began making retching sounds. Kurenai felt the burst of
            malformed chakra when Naruto fired off his technique – she was
            actually surprised he produced anything at all. The other sickly twin
            broke wind so violently that he disappeared with a puff of smoke.</p><P>"Very
            impressive," Shino said in a deadpan voice. "I'm sure if we're
            about to be captured they will be quite a diversion."</p><P>"Kuso!"
            Naruto cursed. His reddened face screwed up in a rictus of
            concentration, he formed the Ram seal again and roared "KAGE
            BUNSHIN NO JUTSU!" at the top of his lungs. Kurenai felt the hairs
            on the back of her neck stir as she felt the massive surge of chakra
            being shaped.</p><P>At
            first Kurenai thought her eyes were blurring, but that was just the
            shimmer that preceded the shadow duplicates as they popped into
            existence. The fact that the blurring covered most of her field of
            vision was because Naruto had filled the clearing with clones. She
            heard Iruka describe how Mizuki had been beaten to within an inch of
            his life, but it was quite another thing to see a genin use a
            jonin-level jutsu to create almost a hundred duplicates of himself.
            The gaki had a right to stand there proudly with his arms folded
            across his chest. Especially since he didn't look like he was about
            to collapse from chakra depletion.</p><P>Shino's
            eyebrows had become visible over his glasses; while Hinata's pearly
            eyes had gone wide as a blush reddened her cheeks.</p><P>"That's
            more like it," Kurenai said warmly. Naruto blinked and scratched at
            the back of his head in embarrassed pleasure. Inside, she was
            saddened. For the boy to react so strongly to a simple compliment…
            It said a lot about his early life, none of it pleasant. Her respect
            for the Sandaime had also taken a hit. The boy deserved a lot better
            than he'd gotten.</p><P>Naruto
            set his clones to sparring one another while Kurenai gestured for
            them to sit down. She ignored the errant clone that made a rude
            gesture at Shino's back, causing Hinata to stifle a giggle.</p><P>"That
            was a very interesting display, all of you. Tonight and tomorrow I'll
            be putting together some training plans for all three of you. We'll
            meet here at noon to discuss these, and then we will report to the
            Hokage for our first mission. So go home and get a good night's
            sleep."</p><P>"Yatta!"
            Naruto yelled, leaping to his feet. "Our first mission!" He
            struck a 'V for Victory' pose that made Kurenai and Hinata smile.
            Shino did not react, at least not visibly.</p><P>As
            Hinata and Shino left, Kurenai tapped Naruto's shoulder. The boy
            shied away from the unexpected touch in a way she found
            disconcerting. "I'd like to talk to you about a couple of
            things," she said in a quiet voice.</p><P>Naruto
            looked at his teammates, who were already out of earshot. He let out
            a resigned sigh and shrugged. Kurenai suppressed the urge to try out
            some phrases she'd picked up from Asuma. Instead, she put on what
            she hoped was a reassuring smile. "Come on," she said. "I'll
            buy you dinner while we talk."</p><P>Naruto
            brightened as they began walking.</p><P>"But
            no ramen."</p><P>He
            frowned.</p><P>"If
            you eat nothing but noodles, it's no wonder you're the shortest
            kid in your class. Don't you know if you don't eat right it will
            stunt your growth?"</p><P>Now
            the boy looked horrified.</p><P>Kurenai
            sighed. "I don't mean never eat it again. But if you don't get
            some vegetables and a good amount of protein and dairy products in
            your diet, you'll never achieve your full growth."</p><P>"I
            drink milk every day," he said defensively.</p><P>"That's
            a good start, but you still need protein, and vegetables contain
            vitamins you can't get anywhere else. It's a wonder you don't
            have rickets or scurvy."</p><P>"Nani?"</p><P>"Those
            are malnutrition-related diseases that sailors used to get when they
            went on long voyages without proper food."</p><P>"How
            do you know so many things?" he asked as they left the training
            area and re-entered the village.</p><P>"I'm
            a jouinin." It was easier than explaining that she was an insomniac
            who read half the night. Reading was a lot easier on her mind than
            thinking about Mattai.</p><P>As
            they walked, Kurenai noticed the subtle glares and sneers the
            villagers directed toward her student. She began returning the
            glares, and made a point of straightening her hitai-ite. She was a
            jonin, by Kami, and she wasn't going to put up with any attitude
            directed toward herself or her student.</p><P>Her
            red eyes were just a Yuuhi family quirk, but back when she was a
            genin, Kurenai developed a low-powered genjutsu that gave her eyes a
            subtle glow. It was more cheap theatrics than anything else, but
            Mattai thought it was hilarious. It was fairly effective on the less
            intelligent residents of Konoha – villagers who thought she was
            'too pretty' to be a ninja, and shinobi who wouldn't take no
            for an answer. The seals were easily performed in an unobtrusive
            fashion and soon she was glowering at anyone who looked twice at her
            charge. The glow was just barely visible in the waning afternoon
            light, and it had the desired effect. Kurenai smothered a smile as a
            particularly obnoxious shopkeeper stumbled over his own merchandise
            when his glaring eyes moved from Naruto to her. The crash of broken
            bottles was music to her ears.</p><P>Naruto
            looked back at her and twitched a little when he saw her eyes. She
            smiled at him and he grinned back. Unlike his previous smiles, this
            one was shy, with just a hint of mischief. Kurenai wondered if this
            was the first honest smile of his that she'd seen.</p><P>Moritake's
            was a small café run by a retired shinobi who'd been a
            friend of Kobaru-sensei. Moritake-san lost most of his lower left leg
            to an explosive tag trap during the war with the hidden village of
            stone, and was retired as an active shinobi. He still tended bar and
            swapped stories with the new graduates, making the place popular with
            ninja of more than one generation.</p><P>Kurenai
            always dropped by on Kobaru-sensei's birthday and on the
            anniversary of that awful day when… Anyway, he recognized her the
            minute she walked in. Naruto rather hesitantly followed her as she
            strolled up to the bar. He obviously wasn't used to this kind of
            place.</p><P>"Kurenai-chan!"
            Moritake-san called out with a smile. "And who is the Gaki?"</p><P>"This
            is Uzumaki Naruto," she said in a loud voice, "one of my new
            students."</p><P>She
            was a little disappointed to see the hesitant expression on
            Moritake's face, but he quickly mastered it and smiled at the boy.
            "I know what she wants, but how about some tea, kid?"</p><P>Naruto
            nodded and Kurenai wondered why he was being so quiet. She accepted
            the warmed bottle of sake with a smile, then placed an order for some
            yakitori, along with steamed rice and vegetables. Carrying their
            drinks, Naruto followed her to a table in the corner.</p><P>They
            sat down and Kurenai poured a saucer of the steaming liquid and used
            it to wash the dust from her throat. She looked over at Naruto, who
            took a sip of his tea, but seemed pensive. Kurenai looked around. Was
            he being quiet because he was nervous being in the restaurant?</p><P>"Have
            you ever been in a place like this before?" she asked him in a
            quiet voice.</p><P>Naruto
            shook his head. "No. I've been to Ichiraku's for ramen, it's
            really good there, and…" his voice trailed off.</p><P>"And
            they don't run you out like other places do?"</p><P>Naruto
            nodded and growled. "Stupid people…" he muttered.</p><P>"I
            know why they act that way," Kurenai said and Naruto stiffened.
            "And you're right," she continued, "they are stupid people."</p><P>Naruto
            looked up at her. "Iruka said he wasn't allowed to tell."</p><P>"He
            isn't. I was there actually, when it happened. I was barely a
            genin, and we were assigned areas well away from the worst of it. No
            one knows why the demon decided to attack Konoha, and I doubt we ever
            will. But the people blaming you for its actions are just trying to
            strike back at something because they have fear and anger left over
            from those days. That still doesn't excuse their behavior though.
            The Hokage's law prohibits me from saying anything to people who
            don't already know – and you know. The law specifically doesn't
            apply to you either – you can tell anyone you want to."</p><P>"Nani?
            Why would I want anyone else to know why all the adults hate me?"</p><P>"I
            don't think all the adults hate you. I certainly don't. You had
            nothing to do with what happened to the village, and you're
            maintaining the seal that makes sure it doesn't happen again. I
            think your friends, your true friends, won't care."</p><P>"I
            don't think I have any friends like that, Kurenai-sensei."</p><P>"Perhaps,
            perhaps not. Maybe you will in the future, so don't close off any
            of your options. Anyway, I wanted to ask you, are you serious about
            your dream? About wanting to become Hokage?"</p><P>"Yes!"
            Naruto said the word so forcefully that people at neighboring tables
            glanced over at them.</p><P>"Being
            the Hokage means making decisions for and protecting the entire
            village and everyone within it," Kurenai informed him. "Including
            the people that glare at you and treat you like a criminal today. Are
            you sure you want to devote your life to protecting them as well?"</p><P>Naruto
            took a deep breath. "I'm already doing that, aren't I? The
            fourth Hokage picked me for some reason to hold back that bastard
            fox. I spend every day keeping it from destroying Konoha. If he
            picked me for that duty, I'd like to think he considered me worthy
            of that responsibility. I just want everyone else to see me that way
            as well, so his choice would not be in vain."</p><P>Kurenai
            leaned back in her chair and took another long swallow of sake. The
            hot alcohol blazed a warm trail down her throat and spread out from
            her stomach. The boy's reasons were not the absolute best, but she
            knew a lot of kids his age whose ambitions were anchored on far less
            worthy soil. "All right," she said, "maybe you will make a
            worthy successor. I'll help you get there."</p><P>Naruto
            stared at her, eyes wide. Maybe she was the first person who hadn't
            laughed at his ambition. She doubted the Hyuuga girl would, but first
            she needed to work up the courage to actually speak to him. Something
            else she needed to work on with the girl.</p><P>"First
            things first," Kurenai continued. "When you have a big goal, the
            first thing to do is to break it up into smaller goals. You can use
            those as milestones toward your final objective. Now, what rank is
            below Hokage?"</p><P>"Jonins
            and special jonins," Naruto replied.</p><P>"And
            before that?"</p><P>"Chuunin."</p><P>"So
            good milestones would be achieving chuunin and jonin, correct?"</p><P>Naruto
            nodded.</p><P>"Okay,
            before you can even think about testing for chuunin, we need to make
            you a solid genin."</p><P>Naruto
            frowned. "I've already made genin," he protested.</p><P>"Naruto,"
            Kurenai said firmly, "I'm not going to lie to you. You are sort
            of a mess right now. You have a lot of potential, but for various
            reasons, some of them most definitely not your fault, you have yet to
            achieve that potential. On the other hand, you also seem willing to
            work hard for your goals, correct?"</p><P>Naruto
            looked hurt, but still nodded.</p><P>"Good.
            A little hard work can make up for a lot." She took another drink
            of her cooling sake. "With your endurance, you should be able to
            make up a lot of ground. I wasn't kidding about your role in the
            team. If things get dicey, they will be depending on you to get them
            out of danger. The more you improve your taijutsu, the better your
            clones will fight. The more ninjutsus you know, the better you can
            utilize that enormous chakra capacity you have. The day will come
            when Shino and Hinata's lives may depend on you. Mine as well. I'm
            going to be setting up a lot of extra training for you, if you are
            willing to do the work. Are you?"</p><P>Kurenai
            found herself blinking rapidly at the expression on Naruto's face.
            That earlier smile was nothing compared to this one. Naruto's hand
            shook where it was gripping the table. "K-kurenai-sama, I-"</p><P>"Just
            work hard at your training," she interrupted him, using a
            purposefully light tone of voice. "And when you're Hokage, assign
            me a bunch of easy missions and we'll call it even, okay?"</p><P>"Hai!"
            Naruto barked.</p><P>Their
            food arrived at that point and with a shared "Itadakimasu!" they
            went to work on it. Kurenai was secretly glad of the interruption.
            Her student was getting a little emotional, and it was becoming
            contagious. He was just so damn earnest, about everything. Kurenai
            was an only child, but now she had a pretty good idea of what it
            would be like to have a younger brother.</p><p>After
            the waitress cleared the plates, Kurenai drank the last of her sake.
            "We also need to do something about that," she said as she
            reached across the table and tugged on Naruto's sleeve.</p><P>"Nani?"</p><P>Kurenai
            frowned. "Er, you aren't color blind, are you?"</p><P>Naruto
            frowned. "No."</p><P>"Then
            you do realize you are wearing a bright orange jumpsuit, right?"</p><P>Naruto
            nodded. 'What's wrong with it?"</p><P>"Naruto,
            we may need to sneak around at some point. That means bright colors
            are not a good idea. That's why Shino and Hinata are wearing
            neutral colors."</p><P>"But
            you're wearing red, and that wrap around thing is black and white,"
            he objected.</p><P>"I
            don't usually wear this in the field, though some kunoichis dress
            in bright colors so they can masquerade as civilian women. Besides, I
            mask my appearance with a genjutsu anyway. The brightest color I wore
            as a genin was such a dark red that it looked like brown from a
            distance."</p><P>"But
            I like this suit," Naruto whined, looking away and frowning.</p><P>Something
            didn't add up for Kurenai. At first she wondered if he couldn't
            afford new clothes. But with the stipend he received from the Hokage,
            and his cheap tastes in food, he shouldn't be hard up for ryou.
            Then she remembered the looks he received from the shopkeepers on the
            way there. "Tell you what, meet me at the Hokage tower at nine and
            I will take you to a place I know."</p><P>Naruto
            looked up and nodded eagerly, confirming her suspicions.</p><P>She
            sat there quietly fuming while they waited for the check. The boy was
            reluctant to put up with abuse from random shopkeepers, but that left
            her wondering where he'd found the orange suit. Maybe it had been
            cast off in a refuse heap, or it had been the only thing they were
            willing to sell to him. Perhaps some worthless trash of a human being
            hoped the bright colors would make him more likely to die on a
            mission.</p><P>Kurenai
            didn't know the owner of the equipment store she frequented, but if
            they snubbed Naruto in front of her it would be the last thing they
            did. Experiencing two hours in the life of Uzumaki Naruto left Yuuhi
            Kurenai ready to commit assault, if not murder.</p><P>After
            she paid the bill, she sent Naruto home with a reminder to meet her
            in the morning. Then she went straight home to her bed. She planned
            to get up very early and have some strong words with the Hokage
            before she took Naruto to get properly outfitted.</p><P>A/N:</p><P>Hello,
            and welcome to my little break from the Potterverse. Don't worry,
            I'm not discontinuing HP&NFP – this is just a mental
            aperitif… Something to cleanse my brain when The Plot That Will Not
            Die is causing mental constipation.</p><P>The
            divergence point that makes this AU is Yuuhi Kurenai's decision to
            take a surreptitious look at the genin candidates after Sarutobi
            asked her to take on a genin team.</p><P>Kurenai's
            past is such a blank page that it leaves me some room to work with.
            As you can tell, part of her decision to be so painstaking with her
            genins is due to a tragedy that befell her own team when she was a
            genin. More about this will be revealed in the future.</p><P>Naruto
            himself will start becoming more and more OOC as time passes. A lot
            of his personality seems to have been formed as a reaction to the
            less-than-benign neglect that has been the basis of his life. I
            always wondered what he would have been like with a solid mentor who
            was really looking out for him. (Yeah, Jiraiya did care for the boy
            later on, but the Toad-Sennin is irresponsibility incarnate.)</p><P>As
            the effects of this one small change start to propagate through the
            original timeline, expect things to start changing more and more.</p><P>So,
            tell me what you think. Reviews are always welcome and spur me to
            write faster.</p><P>Thanks
            for reading and welcome to 2006!</p><P>-Matthew</p>
